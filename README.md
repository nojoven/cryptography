# Cryptography concepts in Python
Learn the security of Stream Ciphers, Block Ciphers, Key Exchange, Public Key, Signatures, Shadow files all with Python
## Purpose of this project
Becoming comfortable with encryption.
In this project we will cover all concepts and security concepts in cryptography to understand the full TLS/SSL protocol stack, how password validation is done and more.
## Topics covered in this project
- The biggest lesson in cryptography is best learned from the ancient Caesar Cipher - a lesson which is counterintuitive and needs a deep understanding to appreciate.

- Why a large key-space itself does not ensure security is best understood by breaking the Substitution Cipher.

- The ideal encryption of One Time Pad, the limitations of it, and why it is not ideal in real-life.

- Stream Ciphers the real life of One Time Pads, why they are used, how easy it is to make mistakes, and how modern day algorithms (e.g. A5/1) did not follow the biggest lesson in cryptography.

- Block Ciphers like DES, AES, and GOST with different modes of operations.

- Show by example why Double DES does not add security but we need Triple DES.

- Understand the challenge of Key Exchange Algorithms (to share a secret key without physical contact) and implement and understand the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.

- Public Key encryption with RSA. Implement and understand the security of RSA. How wrong usage of RSA breaks it.

- Hash functions. How to use them for Digital signatures. Password validation in the login process.

- Understand and implement examples with HMAC.

- Review that we fully understand TLS/SSL protocols and more.
